			<section>DRY - "Don't Repeat Yourself"

					Today we are going to hear about 'DRY' it is an acronym meaning: Don't
					Repeat Yourself it is a principle that focused at reducing repetition
					of your code.

						DRY is important

				<aside class="notes">
					So WHY DRY is important. Repetition of same code is just hard to read
					again and again, it is a big waste of time to read big same parts of
					code, hard to maintain if you want to change something you should
					change same things in a lot of places, it makes problem of a big
					amount of lines, super big files - so you have to scroll those long
					code pages up and down again and again, it just took so much time, of
					course you can use Search to jump to the code you want
					to, but this is so complicated and time consuming. Some times you need
					to jump to 10-15-th finding and you would repeat this process all the
					time all over again, to get to destination place. How bad is this?
					Oopf this is awkward.

						Downsides
					</div>
				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					What Downsides you can imagine?
					You can think - i have wrote at least some working code, with
					duplicates but it works.I don't want to do extra work, why should i
					return to already working code? i just want to move to next tasks .

					For example when you wrote code that works after few hours, and
					sometimes you even don't understand why your code magically start to
					work. In that case my first thoughts - i don't want to break it, it
					finally works.

						Experiments

				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					Do experiments with your code, tweak it, better make researches and
					changes in code, to spend some more time to understand that code. So
					in future, you not gonna spend again 2-3 hours on same code that have
					a little differences and hoping it magically starts to work too. Seems
					reasonable. And big plus you will finally understand your code.

					Other thoughts you can have: You can think - later i'll come back and
					refactor it, i will have free time. But This is trap! Lets be honest
					we never come back with those intentions. Only if we will be forced to
					do it.

					Those thinking leads in future to much - much more time wasting.

						First steps
					</div>
				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					So what are first steps? You can move same parts of code, to function
					and call that function in place where your code had those duplicates.
					But how this would work with differences? You just need to add
					arguments
					to new function and call function passing those code differences as
					arguments.

					Code will become more cleaner. And with practice you will see those
					parts every time.

				<aside class="notes">
					Like mario do, the more you code - more you would upgrade your level
					of understanding, there is so much instruments, ideas how to not
					repeat yourself: a lot of Principles, Patterns, and best Practices.
					All will come with experience and researches.

				<aside class="notes">
					Have you forgot about this slide? Some times Dry - means "DO repeat
					yourself" - for example it's not a good idea trying to merge two
					functions, that do almost same stuff to one, because it just seems
					like this functions have almost same logic and you can refactor them
					to one.
					But in reality you should not do this. Your functions should be
					responsible only for one action. Because functions that do a lot of
					stuff are hard to maintain, to refactor, to add some changes and hard
					to read too. So Before DRY’ing up your code make sure
					you’re facing a real duplication.
					So keep that in mind.

				<aside class="notes">
					For me this idea about DRY code become very beautiful, i start to
					enjoy reading good clean examples of code. And noticed a big
					differences, clean code make me feel happy, gives this felling of
					pleasure, i hope you will enjoy too. Get your code clean as glass of
					water and easy to read as watching a movie!

					Thanks for your attention bye bye!
